# Docker Mentorship

This repository is a supplementary work for our docker basics course under the Engineering Mentorship Programme.

## Lab Week 1

**Week 1 : Dockerfiles and docker commands**

* Create your personal repository in github and clone this repo into your repository
* Select one of the following projects base on your aptitude, i.e. web for FE or playwright for QA
* Create a Dockerfile under the application you selected, hint use `node:16-alpine3.15` as base image
* Build a docker image using the `docker build` command
* Run your `docker container` using the docker run command in `detach` mode
* Commit your changes into your repository and push to github

**NOTE:** Record your screen when running the docker commands and when running the container then pass it to us.
